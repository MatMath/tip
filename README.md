## Tipping Palindrome
Tip Palindrome for US old system

### Why? 
From a Canadian perspective the US is the most backward country in the world when we tip. 
- We have to give the card away, (they probably clone it somewhere).
- We then mentally calculate the Tip & write the number on a piece of paper.
- After we HOPE the waiteress will write the proper amount so we get charged. 

To avoid fraud we have to Keep the 1995 piece of paper all erased and double check 5-10 day after against the bank statement. So... To check fraud fast I want to tip between 15 & 20% but with the Integer & decimal reverse (Palindrome): so 83.38 or 84.48 etc... so if it is different I know something was wrong.

### How it work?
- Cost: 57.23
- Tip: 10.53 @ 18.4% (calculated)
- Total	67.76 (number reversed for later check).
